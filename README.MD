# SeeYourAlgo - Final Project

## So thank god, we have reached the final and complementary part of the project.

For those who see the project in its final state I will preface and say that the project consisted of three parts (of course of course all with dockers :)).
  The previous two parts are:
1. backend
2. frontend
In these directories that are in this repo, each of the parts has its own readme file!


### So first of all, before I start explaining about the project and especially about the third part, I made a short video that is on YouTube and from here you can get an impression of the project and see its actual lectures.

So basically what did we have in the third part?
  Interface to DB (mongoDB) and the option to:
1. You can save the results I got after running.
2. You can get a list of all the results I ran in that session.
3. You can delete all the lectures I saved.
### 4. Consolidation of the entire project into docker compose and "play" of all the micro-services - together.
